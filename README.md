Hello!! This is Tilak Rathi

# Portfolio (reorganized)

This repository is organized into two folders:

- `frontend/` — the Vite + React frontend (your portfolio UI).
- `backend/` — a minimal Express backend with example routes.

## Quick start

### Frontend

1. `cd frontend`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

### Backend

1. `cd backend`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`

## Notes

- `node_modules/` for each side is ignored via `.gitignore`.
- Root `package.json` is set up as a workspace-style “runner” so you can install and run both sides more easily.
